# HTML and CSS Projects

This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

## Projects
- [Space Station Site](Basic_HTML_and_JavaScript_1/Basic_HTML_and_CSS/Project-Copy/index1.html)
- [Movie Theater Side](Basic_HTML_and_JavaScript_1/Basic_HTML_and_CSS/Project-Copy/bootstrap4_project/academny_cinemas.html)


### Space Station Site

This page is an example home page for a Space Travel Company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

### Movie Theater Site

This page is an example home page for a Movie Theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Boostrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
